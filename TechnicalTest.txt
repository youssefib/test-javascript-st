You are given a set of developers and tasks, each with its own properties. Your goal is to assign tasks to developers based on their skills, available hours, and task preferences. Some tasks have dependencies and priorities. You must ensure that the task allocation satisfies these constraints while distributing work as evenly as possible.

Data Structures
Developers:
- name: Developer's name.
- skillLevel: Skill level (1 to 10).
- maxHours: Maximum hours they can work in a week.
- preferredTaskType: Type of task they prefer (e.g., 'feature', 'bug', 'refactor').

Tasks:
- taskName: The name of the task.
- difficulty: Task difficulty (1 to 10).
- hoursRequired: Estimated hours needed to complete.
- taskType: Type of task ('feature', 'bug', 'refactor').
- priority: Task priority (1 to 5).
- dependencies: List of tasks that must be completed before this task.

Example Data:

const developers = [
 { name: 'Alice', skillLevel: 7, maxHours: 40, preferredTaskType: 'feature' },
 { name: 'Bob', skillLevel: 9, maxHours: 30, preferredTaskType: 'bug' },
 { name: 'Charlie', skillLevel: 5, maxHours: 35, preferredTaskType: 'refactor' },
];

const tasks = [
 { taskName: 'Feature A', difficulty: 7, hoursRequired: 15, taskType: 'feature', priority: 4, dependencies: [] },
 { taskName: 'Bug Fix B', difficulty: 5, hoursRequired: 10, taskType: 'bug', priority: 5, dependencies: [] },
 { taskName: 'Refactor C', difficulty: 9, hoursRequired: 25, taskType: 'refactor', priority: 3, dependencies: ['Bug Fix B'] },
 { taskName: 'Optimization D', difficulty: 6, hoursRequired: 20, taskType: 'feature', priority: 2, dependencies: [] },
 { taskName: 'Upgrade E', difficulty: 8, hoursRequired: 15, taskType: 'feature', priority: 5, dependencies: ['Feature A'] },
];

Task:
Write a function `assignTasksWithPriorityAndDependencies` that:
1. Assigns tasks to developers based on their skill levels, available hours, task preferences, priorities, and dependencies.
2. Ensures that tasks with dependencies are only assigned after their prerequisites are complete.
3. Returns an array of developers with their assigned tasks and total work hours.
4. Lists unassigned tasks if no developer can handle them.
5. Prioritizes high-priority tasks while balancing the workload
